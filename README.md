# ResQ
Neural ODE based ResNets on neutral atom quantum computers

# Usage
Training code is written in the Julia programming language, with most of the code being centered around Bloqade.jl, a package for simulating neutral atom systems.
The training code is contained within training.jl, and can be run in the terminal using 

```
julia--project=<path to your julia environment> training.jl <dataset> <lattice shape> <lattice spacing> <classification task>
```
